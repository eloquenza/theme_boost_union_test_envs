# References for the following mapping:
# Moodle requirements for PHP versions:
#   * https://moodledev.io/general/development/policies/php
#   * https://docs.moodle.org/403/en/PHP
# Available docker images:
#   * https://hub.docker.com/r/moodlehq/moodle-php-apache
#
# format:
# mdl_ver:  [oldest_supported_php_ver, newest_supported_php_ver]
# {oldest,newest}_supported_php_ver are in fact docker image tags instead of php versions, but they map onto each other.
# This only works because the moodle-php-apache project defines image tags to be the same as php tags (with a few notable differences, that we do not care for)
# generally: only list breakpoints here, no need to pollute the list.
# e.g. either new Moodle major/minor release, or new PHP requirements
4.3:   [8.0, 8.2]
4.2.3: [8.0, 8.2]
4.2:   [8.0, 8.1]
4.1:   [7.4, 8.1]
4.0:   [7.3, 8.0]
3.11:  [7.3, 8.0]
# 3.10 not listed, has same requirements as 3.9
3.9:   [7.2, 7.4]
3.8.3: [7.1, 7.4]
3.7:   [7.1, 7.3]
# listed as it marks a breakpoint for newest_supported_php_ver
3.6.4: [7.0, 7.3]
# not listing 3.5 and 3.6 as they have the same requirements as 3.4
3.4:   [7.0, 7.2]
# oldest supported version is actually 5.4.4, but the oldest image of the moodle-php-apache uses 5.6 php, so listing that here
3.0.1: [5.6, 7.0]
# we are definitely not supporting older versions
